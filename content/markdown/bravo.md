## Introduction 
Bravo is a platform for organizations and their members where they can share their appreciation for each other. We have provided both aslack application and web application to make it easy for users to receive and give praise, whatever their workflow. 

Our stack is Slack app running from the Slack API, Express and PostgreSQL on Node.JS for our backend, and ReactJS with Redux for ourfront end. 
## Team Workflow 
To organize our team workflow, we used Trello as our primary task management tool. 
We followed a release cycle of a release every 2 weeks, with the aim to push major sections and numerous features each iteration.

As a team, we worked really well when it came to segregating workflows and fixing problems with the proposed features. We had teammeetings twice a day with 1 on 1â€™s once a week and quickly came to understand each other's workflows. We did have issues at the beginningwith conflicting features and duplicated work, but overcame this with better organization and communication.
