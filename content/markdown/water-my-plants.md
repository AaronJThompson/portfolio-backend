## Introduction 
Building a schedule around ensuring that all your plants are watered is actually pretty difficult. Water My Plants helps to solve those problems by providing and easy to use interface for creating a plant watering schedule that will remind users to water their plants on a regular basis.
## Project Overview 
This was a build week project during our time at Lambda, and was built with 3 developers in only 4 days. 1 on backend and 2 on frontend (I worked on frontend).
This was a really fun project. Unfortunately we didn't get time to make it responsive so the web app only functions properly on mobile. However we did get text reminders working and the mobile view turned out really well. This is definetly a project I'll be coming back to when I have time.
